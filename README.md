# R/OSE System Design 
R/OSE is a modular system of robotic, logic and sensor elements that can be used to monitor and care for organic systems. The purpose of R/OSE is to strip down complexity to process and transfer data in the leanest way possible between systems, much in the way information is communicated between symbiotic organisms. This modular style allows for the basic platform to be adapted for use with different components or to interact with different systems.

# Design Requirements and Parameters for R/OSE system
 - Use of cheap-open source components where possible
 - Flexible coding and wiring of system to allow addition or replacement of components and sensors
 - Designed -toward- (baby steps) use with other organic, control and robotic systems
 - Designed towards compatibility with old and new technology

# Questions
 - What kinds of systems could be used? 
 - How “modular”/ easy should the system be?
 - What does a prototype system for one combination look like?
 - How do we make the prototype indicative of the larger system?
 - When do we shift from prototype for one combination to modular approach?
 - How to adequately simplify systems without ludditing it or accidentally aliasing data?
 
 # Possible Organic Systems
 - Algae/ Bacterial Bioreactor
 - Ornamental plant care
 - Mycelium growth
 - Vertical Gardening 
 - Outdoor small-scale farming
 - Aquaponics
 
 
 # Why?
 
Automation and monitoring for organic systems is widespread but are mostly used for predictable systems (bio-reactors) or where scale can make simplification feasible (large-scale agriculture). It allows more nuanced control and management of resources like water and pesticides - using where needed rather than using wastefully as is commonly done in industrial agriculture. They do not work well in other organic systems where unpredictable physical conditions, complex data and multiple organic systems prevent programmatic monitoring and interaction. Sustainable agriculture such as permaculture mimics natural ecosystems in using a network of interactions between different organic components. These systems can be inherently self-sustaining but are very difficult to monitor and automate - which might be needed for producing these systems at scale or in non-natural environments such as space or underground.
